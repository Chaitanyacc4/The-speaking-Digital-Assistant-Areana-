# The-speaking-Digital-Assistant-Areana
Areana is a specialized speaking assistant. Unlike any other type-based chatbots, Areana uses both voice & text inputs and spell out voice responses. It can even perform tasks like opening Youtube, Google, Play Music etc., over your voice input.

# Working:
To keep it simple and understandable to everyone, the code is developed in a simple and organised manner. There are separate functions for every type of request and response. Let’s have a look at different kinds of functions used in the Chat bot:

# 1.	Greeting:

This function comes into action when a keyword like “Hello”, “Hi”, “Good Morning” etc., are given/spoken as inputs.

Appropriate responses are previously recorded and as used as per the requirement basis.

# 2.	Good Bye:

This function gets activated when a request like “Good Bye”, “Bye”, “See you soon” etc., are indulged. Subsequent responses from the pre-determined ones are offered as outputs (as the voice of Areana).

# 3.	Search commands (over Wikipedia):

Whenever a keyword (which is not in the pre-mentioned-list/tasks-list is opted, this function takes the responsibility of creating appropriate answers to them. 
As we have already listed most of the request categories, the unknown request categories could possibly be a search keyword/demands an answer. 

# 4.	Tasks performing:

Areana can also assist you in tasks like "Open Youtube", "Open G-Mail", "Play a song from my playlist" etc., on your voice command. 
It can help you make your every day computer activity hands-free.
